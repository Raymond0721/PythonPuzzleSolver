# PythonPuzzleSolver

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed as part of the CSC148 course at the University of Toronto. It showcases an implementation of various puzzle-solving algorithms, including Sudoku, Word Ladder, and Expression Tree puzzles. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills.

## Contents
- `experiment.py`: General experimentation with puzzle solutions.
- `expression_tree.py`: Implementation of the Expression Tree puzzle.
- `expression_tree_puzzle.py`: Specific configuration and setup for the Expression Tree puzzle.
- `play_expression_tree_puzzle.py`: Script to play the Expression Tree puzzle.
- `play_sudoku.py`: Script to play the Sudoku puzzle.
- `play_word_ladder.py`: Script to play the Word Ladder puzzle.
- `puzzle.py`: Base classes and interfaces for puzzle implementation.
- `solver.py`: Generic solver implementing the automatic puzzle-solving algorithm.
- `sudoku_puzzle.py`: Implementation of the Sudoku puzzle.
- `word_ladder_puzzle.py`: Implementation of the Word Ladder puzzle.
- `adts.py`: Abstract Data Types used in the puzzle implementations.

## How to Run
To run the puzzle games, execute the corresponding `play_xxxx.py` files. For example:
- To play Sudoku, run `play_sudoku.py`
- To play Word Ladder, run `play_word_ladder.py`
- To play the Expression Tree Puzzle, run `play_expression_tree_puzzle.py`

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we implemented various algorithms and data structures including stacks, queues, breadth-first search (BFS), and depth-first search (DFS). These techniques were instrumental in solving complex puzzles and enhanced our understanding of algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
